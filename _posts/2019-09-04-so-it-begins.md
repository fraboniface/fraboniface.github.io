title: So it begins

This is my first post. Hope you didn't miss the reference to LOTR in the title. If you did, then I'm still happy: it means normal people are reading my blog.

I'm not going to present myself or this blog in this post, you can go to the [About page](/about/).
I'm just going to explain the rules of the game and tell you about my next posts.

### Topics
As I explain in the About page, I plan to write about the following subjects:
- sustainability, including the environment, economics, and politics;
- artificial intelligence, both vulgarization and technical articles;
- health, in particular sports and nutrition;
- random stuffs that I want to talk about.

Here are some articles in the pipe:
- machine learning: latest important advances in Natural Language Processing;
- health: my experience of fasting and hiking for five days with a friend;
- energy: an in-depth study of nuclear energy;
- sustainability: growth, the exponential function, and our brain;
- environment: ecology for capitalists;
- economics: an introduction to Modern Monetary Theory.

### Posting frequency
I have no rule, for now. I will spend as much time as necessary on my posts. The question is whether to break down long articles in several installments.
I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I know shorter posts make for an easier read and will be read by more people.
On the other hand, I *love* very long texts when they are interesting and well written. The best example I know of this is Tim Urban's [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/).
In short, I don't know.

### Length of my articles
Again, I don't have a satisfying answer. The one about nuclear energy is already several thousand words. As I said, I might cut it into pieces.
Others could be quite short, about 5 to 10 minutes reads.
I will most of the time try to dig into the subject, to provide readers an understanding from the ground up, so few posts will be short.

### Language
You probably noticed that this blog is bilingual English-French. That's because I'm French, and I know that many of my compatriots don't read English fluently.
Not all posts will be available in both languages. Translated articles will be in separate posts. Later on, I would like people to see only one language and change it with a button if they want.
I'm not a web developer, though, and this is a static site, so I'll need some time to figure it out.

I lived in the UK for a time, and to be honest I'm not a huge fan of America, so I will prefer UK English. Since I don't speak it perfectly, it's entirely possible that I use American English instead, or simply make mistakes. Don't hesitate to tell me about it. Even if it's technically correct, tell me if it sounds weird of if natives would say it differently. See the Contact paragraph.

I'm currently reading [*The Elements of Style*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)[^1] for work; hopefully it will bear fruits. However, like Tim Urban, I will favour understanding over formality, so my style may vary.

[^1]: I'm not a fan of Amazon, so I won't link to it unless required. I encourage you to go to a bookshop.
